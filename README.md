## I'm Danielle

:woman_technologist: I am currently completing a software engineering fellowship with Per Scholas focusing on responsive, full-stack web applications, specializing in JavaScript and related technologies.

While I am currently focused on learning all things software engineering, I also enjoy picking up and using other tech to solve problems. Some of those hobbies include:
- Smart Home Tech (Pi-Hole)
- Home Automation (Home Assistant)
- 3D Printing - including designing the thing to print, not just finding it online!

I also have other hobbies too:
- helping others troubleshoot their code
- playing with and training my dog
- reading sci-fi/fantasy novels (Terry Pratchett is one of my favorite authors)
- playing and modding video games
- backpacking/camping
- cooking

## Where else can you find me?
