# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

## I'm Danielle

...and I am a Full-Stack Web Developer specializing in JavaScript and related technologies. While I am currently focused on learning all things software engineering, I also enjoy picking up and using other tech to solve problems. Some of those hobbies include:
- Smart Home Automation
- 3D Printing
- Mechanical Engineering

I also have other hobbies too:
- playing with and training my dog
- reading sci-fi/fantasy novels (Terry Pratchett is one of my favorite authors)
- playing and modding video games
- backpacking/camping
- cooking

## Where else can you find me?
