### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<strong>I'm Danielle</strong>

...and I am a Full-Stack Web Developer specializing in JavaScript and related technologies. While I am currently focused on learning all things web development, I also enjoy picking up and using other tech to solve problems. Some of those hobbies include: 
<ul>
  <li>Smart Home Automation</li>
  <li>3D Printing</li>
  <li>Mechanical Engineering</li>
 </ul>

I also have other "normal people" hobbies too, like:
reading sci-fi/fantasy novels (Terry Pratchett is one of my favorite authors), playing video games, backpacking/camping, and, last but not least, cooking!
